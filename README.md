# coursera_crashcourse_python

In this I have uploaded My final project for Coursera's Crash course of python by Google.

I have written a script which reads a text document first, then removes all the punctuations and eliminates all the unwanted words from the file.
It returns  dictionary for all the words and number of times it appeared.

You can then see them in the wordcloud.
